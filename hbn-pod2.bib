              application of population neuroscience in studies of brain

              assessments of environmental and genetic ``exposures,'' and
              measurements of brain and behavior ``outcomes.'' I then discuss
              challenges faced by investigators carrying out such MR-based
              studies, including quality assurance, quality control and
              intersite coordination, and provide a brief overview of the

  abstract = {Over a decade ago, the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) pioneered
              open-access data sharing in the task-based functional
              neuroimaging community. Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort
              encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that
              impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing.
              In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in
              the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two
              grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project
              (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging
              Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to
              thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP
              and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data
              aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the
              success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with
              widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent
              of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and
              include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the
              logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open
              science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of
              these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives

               using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and

               all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup
               and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the
               BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous
               containerized data processing solutions were limited to single
               user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High

               limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container
               technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by
               22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is interest in using convolutional neural
              networks (CNNs) to analyze medical imaging to provide
              computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Recent work has suggested that
              image classification CNNs may not generalize to new data as well
              as previously believed. We assessed how well CNNs generalized
              across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening
              task. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional design with
              multiple model training cohorts was used to evaluate model
              generalizability to external sites using split-sample validation.
              A total of 158,323 chest radiographs were drawn from three
              institutions: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH;
              112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH; 42,396
              from 12,904 patients), and Indiana University Network for Patient
              Care (IU; 3,807 from 3,683 patients). These patient populations
              had an age mean (SD) of 46.9 years (16.6), 63.2 years (16.5), and
              49.6 years (17) with a female percentage of 43.5\%, 44.8\%, and
              57.3\%, respectively. We assessed individual models using the
              area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for
              radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia and compared
              performance on different test sets with DeLong's test. The
              prevalence of pneumonia was high enough at MSH (34.2\%) relative
              to NIH and IU (1.2\% and 1.0\%) that merely sorting by hospital
              system achieved an AUC of 0.861 (95\% CI 0.855-0.866) on the
              joint MSH-NIH dataset. Models trained on data from either NIH or
              MSH had equivalent performance on IU (P values 0.580 and 0.273,
              respectively) and inferior performance on data from each other
              relative to an internal test set (i.e., new data from within the
              hospital system used for training data; P values both <0.001).
              The highest internal performance was achieved by combining
              training and test data from MSH and NIH (AUC 0.931, 95\% CI
              0.927-0.936), but this model demonstrated significantly lower
              external performance at IU (AUC 0.815, 95\% CI 0.745-0.885, P =
              0.001). To test the effect of pooling data from sites with
              disparate pneumonia prevalence, we used stratified subsampling to
              generate MSH-NIH cohorts that only differed in disease prevalence
              between training data sites. When both training data sites had
              the same pneumonia prevalence, the model performed consistently
              on external IU data (P = 0.88). When a 10-fold difference in
              pneumonia rate was introduced between sites, internal test
              performance improved compared to the balanced model (10$\times$
              MSH risk P < 0.001; 10$\times$ NIH P = 0.002), but this
              outperformance failed to generalize to IU (MSH 10$\times$ P <
              0.001; NIH 10$\times$ P = 0.027). CNNs were able to directly
              detect hospital system of a radiograph for 99.95\% NIH
              (22,050/22,062) and 99.98\% MSH (8,386/8,388) radiographs. The
              primary limitation of our approach and the available public data
              is that we cannot fully assess what other factors might be
              contributing to hospital system-specific biases. CONCLUSION:
              Pneumonia-screening CNNs achieved better internal than external
              performance in 3 out of 5 natural comparisons. When models were
              trained on pooled data from sites with different pneumonia
              prevalence, they performed better on new pooled data from these
              sites but not on external data. CNNs robustly identified hospital
              system and department within a hospital, which can have large
              differences in disease burden and may confound predictions.},

  abstract    = {We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives (O3D)
                 repository: an integrated collection of preserved brain data
                 derivatives and processing pipelines, published together using
                 a single digital-object-identifier. The data derivatives were
                 generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
                 imaging data (dMRI) with diverse properties of resolution and
                 signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to the data, we publish all
                 processing pipelines (also referred to as open cloud
                 services). The pipelines utilize modern methods for
                 neuroimaging data processing (diffusion-signal modelling,
                 fiber tracking, tractography evaluation, white matter
                 segmentation, and structural connectome construction). The O3D
                 open services can allow cognitive and clinical neuroscientists
                 to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new,
                 user-uploaded, data. Open source code implementing all O3D
                 services is also provided to allow computational and computer
                 scientists to reuse and extend the processing methods.
                 Publishing both data-derivatives and integrated processing
                 pipeline promotes practices for scientific reproducibility and
                 data upcycling by providing open access to the research assets
                 for utilization by multiple scientific communities.},

  abstract = {Advancements in technology over the last two decades have changed
              how spatial data are created and used. In particular, in the last
              decade, volunteered geographic information (VGI), i.e., the
              crowdsourcing of geographic information, has revolutionized the
              spatial domain by shifting the map-making process from the hands
              of experts to those of any willing contributor. Started in 2004,
              OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the pinnacle of VGI due to the large
              number of volunteers involved and the volume of spatial data
              generated. While the original objective of OSM was to create a
              free map of the world, its uses have shown how the potential of
              such an initiative goes well beyond map-making: ranging from
              projects such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) project,
              that understands itself as a bridge between the OSM community and
              humanitarian responders, to collaborative projects such as
              Mapillary, where citizens take street-level images and the system
              aims to automate mapping. A common trend among these projects
              using OSM is the fact that the community dynamic tends to create
              spin-off projects. Currently, we see a drive towards projects
              that support sustainability goals using OSM. We discuss some such
              applications and highlight challenges posed by this new paradigm.
              We also explore the most promising future uses of this
              increasingly popular participatory phenomenon.},

  abstract    = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic
                 resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying
                 microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many
                 other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical
                 between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images
                 across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional
                 anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy
                 participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that
                 the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting
                 the need of correcting for site effects before performing
                 downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that
                 combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization,
                 may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the
                 inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization
                 approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular
                 batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best
                 at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability
                 in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of
                 interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological
                 variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by
                 site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods
                 in the presence of different levels of confounding between
                 site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample
                 size studies.},

  abstract    = {With the proliferation of multi-site neuroimaging studies,
                 there is a greater need for handling non-biological variance
                 introduced by differences in MRI scanners and acquisition
                 protocols. Such unwanted sources of variation, which we refer
                 to as ``scanner effects'', can hinder the detection of imaging
                 features associated with clinical covariates of interest and
                 cause spurious findings. In this paper, we investigate scanner
                 effects in two large multi-site studies on cortical thickness
                 measurements across a total of 11 scanners. We propose a set
                 of tools for visualizing and identifying scanner effects that
                 are generalizable to other modalities. We then propose to use
                 ComBat, a technique adopted from the genomics literature and
                 recently applied to diffusion tensor imaging data, to combine
                 and harmonize cortical thickness values across scanners. We
                 show that ComBat removes unwanted sources of scan variability
                 while simultaneously increasing the power and reproducibility
                 of subsequent statistical analyses. We also show that ComBat
                 is useful for combining imaging data with the goal of studying
                 life-span trajectories in the brain.},

                 and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the
                 non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is
                 routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there
                 has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and

                 quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic

                 for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian
                 behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this
                 method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such
                 as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an
                 extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that
                 requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified
                 image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion
                 coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess

                 distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure
                 from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult

                 significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter,
                 reflecting the structural differences between these two types
                 of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related
                 to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of
                 imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing
                 effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure
                 abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

  abstract    = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust
                 inferences from diffusion MRI can be challenging and is
                 subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion
                 indices and eventually comparing them between groups of
                 subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts
                 at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long
                 pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is
                 susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the
                 accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors.
                 This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the
                 analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are
                 grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the
                 tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4
                 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally
                 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region
                 of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based
                 analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion
                 MRI analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and
                 eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of
                 interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We
                 have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported)
                 into a single article, which should serve as a useful
                 reference for those embarking on new diffusion MRI-based
                 studies, and as a check for those who may already be running
                 studies but may have overlooked some important confounds.
                 While some of these problems are well known to diffusion
                 experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to
                 undertake a clinical study based on diffusion MRI.},

  abstract    = {Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the
                 investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior
                 relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric
                 and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue
                 classification is important for quality research and, in
                 particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical
                 practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct
                 various errors inherent to all currently available
                 segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes
                 methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of
                 increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the
                 rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed
                 Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the
                 collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing
                 outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to
                 organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data,
                 an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing
                 toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is
                 flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software
                 package in any data organization structure. Example
                 configurations for three large, open-source datasets are
                 presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the
                 Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the
                 Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These
                 demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics,
                 regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging
                 viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement
                 quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and
                 complexity of study.},

  abstract    = {Big Data promises to advance science through data-driven
                 discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual
                 examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets.
                 Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert
                 examination. We propose to (1) start with expertly labeled
                 data, (2) amplify labels through web applications that engage
                 citizen scientists, and (3) train machine learning on
                 amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this,
                 we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic
                 resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by
                 citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep
                 learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality,
                 based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as
                 well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC =
                 0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can
                 generalize and scale expert decision making; this is
                 particularly important in disciplines where specialized,
                 automated tools do not yet exist.},

  abstract  = {A common approach to medical image analysis on volumetric data
               uses deep 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is
               largely attributed to the challenges imposed by the nature of
               the 3D data: variable volume size, GPU exhaustion during
               optimization. However, dealing with the individual slices
               independently in 2D CNNs deliberately discards the depth
               information which results in poor performance for the intended
               task. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that not
               only overcome the heavy memory and computation requirements but
               also leverage the 3D information. To this end, we evaluate a set
               of volume uniformizing methods to address the aforementioned
               issues. The first method involves sampling information evenly
               from a subset of the volume. Another method exploits the full
               geometry of the 3D volume by interpolating over the z-axis. We
               demonstrate performance improvements using controlled ablation
               studies as well as put this approach to the test on the
               ImageCLEF Tuberculosis Severity Assessment 2019 benchmark. We
               report 73\% area under curve (AUC) and binary classification
               accuracy (ACC) of 67.5\% on the test set beating all methods
               which leveraged only image information (without using clinical
               meta-data) achieving 5-th position overall. All codes and models

  abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a
              method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts)
              in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an
              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We
              demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in
              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the
              preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA
              measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left
              superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the
              correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We
              introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract
              quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI
              parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation,
              AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical
              management and decision-making.},

                 circuits and their relationship to behavior in a large

                 progress made during the first half of the 5-year project in
                 refining the methods for data acquisition and analysis.
                 Preliminary analyses based on a finalized set of acquisition
                 and preprocessing protocols demonstrate the exceptionally high
                 quality of the data from each modality. The first quarterly
                 release of imaging and behavioral data via the ConnectomeDB
                 database demonstrates the commitment to making HCP datasets
                 freely accessible. Altogether, the progress to date provides
                 grounds for optimism that the HCP datasets and associated
                 methods and software will become increasingly valuable
                 resources for characterizing human brain connectivity and

                 modalities together in a common automated preprocessing
                 framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data
                 acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on
                 conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly
                 developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal
                 preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and
                 diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish
                 many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion
                 removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and
                 alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially
                 designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the
                 HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently
                 introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate
                 spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical
                 surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the
                 storage and processing requirements for high spatial and
                 temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image
                 acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing
                 pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested
                 in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these
                 pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: As greater numbers of us are living longer, it is
                 increasingly important to understand how we can age healthily.
                 Although old age is often stereotyped as a time of declining
                 mental abilities and inflexibility, cognitive neuroscience
                 reveals that older adults use neural and cognitive resources
                 flexibly, recruiting novel neural regions and cognitive
                 processes when necessary. Our aim in this project is to
                 understand how age-related changes to neural structure and
                 function interact to support cognitive abilities across the
                 lifespan. METHODS/DESIGN: We are recruiting a population-based
                 cohort of 3000 adults aged 18 and over into Stage 1 of the
                 project, where they complete an interview including health and
                 lifestyle questions, a core cognitive assessment, and a
                 self-completed questionnaire of lifetime experiences and
                 physical activity. Of those interviewed, 700 participants aged
                 18-87 (100 per age decile) continue to Stage 2 where they
                 undergo cognitive testing and provide measures of brain
                 structure and function. Cognition is assessed across multiple
                 domains including attention and executive control, language,
                 memory, emotion, action control and learning. A subset of 280
                 adults return for in-depth neurocognitive assessment in Stage
                 3, using functional neuroimaging experiments across our key
                 cognitive domains.Formal statistical models will be used to
                 examine the changes that occur with healthy ageing, and to
                 evaluate age-related reorganisation in terms of cognitive and
                 neural functions invoked to compensate for overall age-related
                 brain structural decline. Taken together the three stages
                 provide deep phenotyping that will allow us to measure neural
                 activity and flexibility during performance across a number of
                 core cognitive functions. This approach offers
                 hypothesis-driven insights into the relationship between brain
                 and behaviour in healthy ageing that are relevant to the
                 general population. DISCUSSION: Our study is a unique resource
                 of neuroimaging and cognitive measures relevant to change
                 across the adult lifespan. Because we focus on normal
                 age-related changes, our results may contribute to changing
                 views about the ageing process, lead to targeted
                 interventions, and reveal how normal ageing relates to frail
                 ageing in clinicopathological conditions such as Alzheimer's
                 disease.},

We identify two fundamental axioms—Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.}

  abstract  = {The recent surge in interpretability research has led to confusion on numerous fronts. In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work.Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

  abstract    = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has become a popular imaging
                 modality for probing the microstructural properties of white
                 matter and comparing them between populations in vivo.
                 However, the contrast in DW-MRI arises from the microscopic
                 random motion of water molecules in brain tissues, which makes
                 it particularly sensitive to macroscopic head motion. Although
                 this has been known since the introduction of DW-MRI, most
                 studies that use this modality for group comparisons do not
                 report measures of head motion for each group and rely on
                 registration-based correction methods that cannot eliminate
                 the full effects of head motion on the DW-MRI contrast. In
                 this work we use data from children with autism and typically
                 developing children to investigate the effects of head motion
                 on differences in anisotropy and diffusivity measures between
                 groups. We show that group differences in head motion can
                 induce group differences in DW-MRI measures, and that this is
                 the case even when comparing groups that include control
                 subjects only, where no anisotropy or diffusivity differences
                 are expected. We also show that such effects can be more
                 prominent in some white-matter pathways than others, and that
                 they can be ameliorated by including motion as a nuisance
                 regressor in the analyses. Our results demonstrate the
                 importance of taking head motion into account in any
                 population study where one group might exhibit more head
                 motion than the other.},

                 registration and regression of motion estimates from the data.
                 These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation
                 structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many
                 long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion,
                 whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These
                 changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are
                 they adequately countered by, some common functional
                 connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are
                 proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects

  abstract    = {It has recently been reported (Van Dijk et al., 2011) that
                 in-scanner head motion can have a substantial impact on MRI
                 measurements of resting-state functional connectivity. This
                 finding may be of particular relevance for studies of
                 neurodevelopment in youth, confounding analyses to the extent
                 that motion and subject age are related. Furthermore, while
                 Van Dijk et al. demonstrated the effect of motion on
                 seed-based connectivity analyses, it is not known how motion
                 impacts other common measures of connectivity. Here we expand
                 on the findings of Van Dijk et al. by examining the effect of
                 motion on multiple types of resting-state connectivity
                 analyses in a large sample of children and adolescents
                 (n=456). Following replication of the effect of motion on
                 seed-based analyses, we examine the influence of motion on
                 graphical measures of network modularity, dual-regression of
                 independent component analysis, as well as the amplitude and
                 fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation. In the
                 entire sample, subject age was highly related to motion. Using
                 a subsample where age and motion were unrelated, we
                 demonstrate that motion has marked effects on connectivity in
                 every analysis examined. While subject age was associated with
                 increased within-network connectivity even when motion was
                 accounted for, controlling for motion substantially attenuated
                 the strength of this relationship. The results demonstrate the
                 pervasive influence of motion on multiple types functional
                 connectivity analysis, and underline the importance of
                 accounting for motion in studies of neurodevelopment.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, there has been growing enthusiasm that
                 functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could achieve
                 clinical utility for a broad range of neuropsychiatric
                 disorders. However, several barriers remain. For example, the
                 acquisition of large-scale datasets capable of clarifying the
                 marked heterogeneity that exists in psychiatric illnesses will
                 need to be realized. In addition, there continues to be a need
                 for the development of image processing and analysis methods
                 capable of separating signal from artifact. As a prototypical
                 hyperkinetic disorder, and movement-related artifact being a
                 significant confound in functional imaging studies, ADHD
                 offers a unique challenge. As part of the ADHD-200 Global
                 Competition and this special edition of Frontiers, the
                 ADHD-200 Consortium demonstrates the utility of an aggregate
                 dataset pooled across five institutions in addressing these
                 challenges. The work aimed to (1) examine the impact of
                 emerging techniques for controlling for ``micro-movements,''
                 and (2) provide novel insights into the neural correlates of
                 ADHD subtypes. Using support vector machine (SVM)-based
                 multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) we show that functional
                 connectivity patterns in individuals are capable of
                 differentiating the two most prominent ADHD subtypes. The
                 application of graph-theory revealed that the Combined
                 (ADHD-C) and Inattentive (ADHD-I) subtypes demonstrated some
                 overlapping (particularly sensorimotor systems), but unique
                 patterns of atypical connectivity. For ADHD-C, atypical
                 connectivity was prominent in midline default network
                 components, as well as insular cortex; in contrast, the ADHD-I
                 group exhibited atypical patterns within the dlPFC regions and
                 cerebellum. Systematic motion-related artifact was noted, and
                 highlighted the need for stringent motion correction. Findings
                 reported were robust to the specific motion correction
                 strategy employed. These data suggest that resting-state
                 functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data can be used to
                 characterize individual patients with ADHD and to identify
                 neural distinctions underlying the clinical heterogeneity of
                 ADHD.},

              numerous clinical applications for diagnosis and treatment
              decisions. Deep neural networks have shown the same or better
              performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the rapid
              increase in the available data and computational power. In order
              to conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential
              that the AI system be transparent, robust, fair, and ensure
              accountability. Current deep neural solutions are referred to as
              black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the specifics
              concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a
              need to ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks
              before they can be incorporated into the routine clinical

  abstract    = {The use of black box algorithms in medicine has raised
                 scholarly concerns due to their opaqueness and lack of
                 trustworthiness. Concerns about potential bias, accountability
                 and responsibility, patient autonomy and compromised trust
                 transpire with black box algorithms. These worries connect
                 epistemic concerns with normative issues. In this paper, we
                 outline that black box algorithms are less problematic for
                 epistemic reasons than many scholars seem to believe. By
                 outlining that more transparency in algorithms is not always
                 necessary, and by explaining that computational processes are
                 indeed methodologically opaque to humans, we argue that the
                 reliability of algorithms provides reasons for trusting the
                 outcomes of medical artificial intelligence (AI). To this end,
                 we explain how computational reliabilism, which does not
                 require transparency and supports the reliability of
                 algorithms, justifies the belief that results of medical AI
                 are to be trusted. We also argue that several ethical concerns
                 remain with black box algorithms, even when the results are
                 trustworthy. Having justified knowledge from reliable
                 indicators is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for
                 normatively justifying physicians to act. This means that
                 deliberation about the results of reliable algorithms is
                 required to find out what is a desirable action. Thus
                 understood, we argue that such challenges should not dismiss
                 the use of black box algorithms altogether but should inform
                 the way in which these algorithms are designed and
                 implemented. When physicians are trained to acquire the
                 necessary skills and expertise, and collaborate with medical
                 informatics and data scientists, black box algorithms can
                 contribute to improving medical care.},

              Biobank dataset with 1193 eyes of 863 healthy subjects and 1283
              eyes of 771 subjects with glaucoma. We trained a multi-modal
              model that combines multiple deep neural nets, trained on macular
              optical coherence tomography volumes and color fundus photos,
              with demographic and clinical data. We performed an
              interpretability analysis to identify features the model relied
              on to detect glaucoma. We determined the importance of different
              features in detecting glaucoma using interpretable machine
              learning methods. We also evaluated the model on subjects who did
              not have a diagnosis of glaucoma on the day of imaging but were
              later diagnosed (progress-to-glaucoma, PTG). RESULTS: Results
              show that a multi-modal model that combines imaging with
              demographic and clinical features is highly accurate (AUC 0.97).
              Interpretation of this model highlights biological features known
              to be related to the disease, such as age, intraocular pressure,
              and optic disc morphology. Our model also points to previously
              unknown or disputed features, such as pulmonary function and
              retinal outer layers. Accurate prediction in PTG highlights
              variables that change with progression to glaucoma - age and
              pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of our model
              suggests distinct sources of information in each imaging modality
              and in the different clinical and demographic variables.
              Interpretable machine learning methods elucidate subject-level
              prediction and help uncover the factors that lead to accurate
              predictions, pointing to potential disease mechanisms or

                 ninety-six retinal fundus images from 1612 diabetic patients.
                 METHODS: Ten ophthalmologists (5 general ophthalmologists, 4
                 retina specialists, 1 retina fellow) read images for DR
                 severity based on the International Clinical Diabetic
                 Retinopathy disease severity scale in each of 3 conditions:
                 unassisted, grades only, or grades plus heatmap. Grades-only
                 assistance comprised a histogram of DR predictions (grades)
                 from a trained deep-learning model. For grades plus heatmap,

                 specificity of each reader and the algorithm for different
                 levels of DR severity against an adjudicated reference

                 reader-reported confidence (5-point Likert scale), and grading

                 assistance than without for the grades-only condition (P <
                 0.001). Grades plus heatmaps improved accuracy for patients
                 with DR (P < 0.001), but reduced accuracy for patients without
                 DR (P = 0.006). Both forms of assistance increased readers'
                 sensitivity moderate-or-worse DR: unassisted: mean, 79.4\%
                 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 72.3\%-86.5\%]; grades only:
                 mean, 87.5\% [95\% CI, 85.1\%-89.9\%]; grades plus heatmap:
                 mean, 88.7\% [95\% CI, 84.9\%-92.5\%] without a corresponding
                 drop in specificity (unassisted: mean, 96.6\% [95\% CI,
                 95.9\%-97.4\%]; grades only: mean, 96.1\% [95\% CI,
                 95.5\%-96.7\%]; grades plus heatmap: mean, 95.5\% [95\% CI,
                 94.8\%-96.1\%]). Algorithmic assistance increased the accuracy
                 of retina specialists above that of the unassisted reader or
                 model alone; and increased grading confidence and grading time
                 across all readers. For most cases, grades plus heatmap was
                 only as effective as grades only. Over the course of the
                 experiment, grading time decreased across all conditions,
                 although most sharply for grades plus heatmap. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Deep learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of, and
                 confidence in, DR diagnosis in an assisted read setting. They
                 also may increase grading time, although these effects may be
                 ameliorated with experience.},

               high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems
               in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people
               hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models
               will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black
               box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable
               in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can
               potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to
               design models that are inherently interpretable. This
               Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes
               and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key
               reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in
               high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable
               machine learning, and provides several example applications
               where interpretable models could potentially replace black box
               models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.
               There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods
               for `explainable AI', where models are created to explain how a
               first `black box' machine learning model arrives at a specific
               decision. It can be argued that instead efforts should be
               directed at building inherently interpretable models in the
               first place, in particular where they are applied in
               applications that directly affect human lives, such as in

                 morphometry, or TBM, for measurement and analysis of diffusion
                 MRI data along white matter fiber tracts. Using
                 subject-specific tractography bundle segmentations, we
                 generate an arc length parameterization of the bundle with
                 point correspondences across all fibers and all subjects,
                 allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this paper
                 we present a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate
                 systems from the literature and we introduce an improved
                 optimal match method that reduces spatial distortion and
                 improves intra- and inter-subject variability of FA
                 measurements. We propose a method for generating arc length
                 correspondences across hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of
                 interhemispheric diffusion asymmetries in the arcuate
                 fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB). The results of this
                 study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences that may not
                 be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in entire
                 tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found in
                 AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA)
                 in the left hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower
                 lambda(3), the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in
                 the left AF), and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to
                 higher lambda(1), the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion
                 tensor, in the left CB). By mapping the significance levels
                 onto the tractography trajectories for each structure, we
                 demonstrate the anatomical locations of the interhemispheric
                 differences. The TBM approach brings analysis of DTI data into
                 the clinically and neuroanatomically relevant framework of the

  abstract = {Diffusion imaging tractography is a valuable tool for
              neuroscience researchers because it allows the generation of
              individualized virtual dissections of major white matter tracts
              in the human brain. It facilitates between-subject statistical
              analyses tailored to the specific anatomy of each participant.
              There is prominent variation in diffusion imaging metrics (e.g.,
              fractional anisotropy, FA) within tracts, but most tractography
              studies use a ``tract-averaged'' approach to analysis by
              averaging the scalar values from the many streamline vertices in
              a tract dissection into a single point-spread estimate for each
              tract. Here we describe a complete workflow needed to conduct an
              along-tract analysis of white matter streamline tract groups.
              This consists of 1) A flexible MATLAB toolkit for generating
              along-tract data based on B-spline resampling and compilation of
              scalar data at different collections of vertices along the
              curving tract spines, and 2) Statistical analysis and rich data
              visualization by leveraging tools available through the R
              platform for statistical computing. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of such an along-tract approach over the
              tract-averaged approach in an example analysis of 10 major white
              matter tracts in a single subject. We also show that these
              techniques easily extend to between-group analyses typically used
              in neuroscience applications, by conducting an along-tract
              analysis of differences in FA between 9 individuals with fetal
              alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) and 11 typically-developing
              controls. This analysis reveals localized differences between
              FASD and control groups that were not apparent using a
              tract-averaged method. Finally, to validate our approach and
              highlight the strength of this extensible software framework, we
              implement 2 other methods from the literature and leverage the
              existing workflow tools to conduct a comparison study.},

  abstract    = {The white matter contains long-range connections between
                 different brain regions and the organization of these
                 connections holds important implications for brain function in
                 health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted
                 magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue
                 properties along the trajectories of these connections.
                 Statistical inference from tractometry usually either averages
                 these quantities along the length of each fiber bundle or
                 computes regression models separately for each point along
                 every one of the bundles. These approaches are limited in
                 their sensitivity, in the former case, or in their statistical
                 power, in the latter. We developed a method based on the
                 sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue
                 properties along all of the bundles and selects informative
                 features by enforcing both global and bundle-level sparsity.
                 We demonstrate the performance of the method in two settings:
                 i) in a classification setting, patients with amyotrophic
                 lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished from
                 matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the
                 corticospinal tract as important for this classification,
                 correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be
                 affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL
                 accurately predicts ``brain age.'' In this case, the weights
                 are distributed throughout the white matter indicating that
                 many different regions of the white matter change over the
                 lifespan. Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships
                 between diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make
                 accurate phenotypic predictions while simultaneously
                 discovering the most relevant features of the white matter.},

  abstract    = {As our brains age, we tend to experience cognitive decline and
                 are at greater risk of neurodegenerative disease and dementia.
                 Symptoms of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases are also
                 exacerbated during ageing. However, the ageing process does
                 not affect people uniformly; nor, in fact, does the ageing
                 process appear to be uniform even within an individual. Here,
                 we outline recent neuroimaging research into brain ageing and
                 the use of other bodily ageing biomarkers, including telomere
                 length, the epigenetic clock, and grip strength. Some of these
                 techniques, using statistical approaches, have the ability to
                 predict chronological age in healthy people. Moreover, they
                 are now being applied to neurological and psychiatric disease
                 groups to provide insights into how these diseases interact
                 with the ageing process and to deliver individualised
                 predictions about future brain and body health. We discuss the
                 importance of integrating different types of biological
                 measurements, from both the brain and the rest of the body, to
                 build more comprehensive models of the biological ageing
                 process. Finally, we propose seven steps for the field of
                 brain-ageing research to take in coming years. This will help
                 us reach the long-term goal of developing clinically
                 applicable statistical models of biological processes to
                 measure, track and predict brain and body health in ageing and
                 disease.},

  abstract = {Properties of human brain tissue change across the lifespan. Here
              we model these changes in the living human brain by combining
              quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of R1
              (1/T1) with diffusion MRI and tractography (N=102, ages 7--85).
              The amount of R1 change during development differs between
              white-matter fascicles, but in each fascicle the rate of
              development and decline are mirror-symmetric; the rate of R1
              development as the brain approaches maturity predicts the rate of
              R1 degeneration in aging. Quantitative measurements of
              macromolecule tissue volume (MTV) confirm that R1 is an accurate
              index of the growth of new brain tissue. In contrast to R1,
              diffusion development follows an asymmetric time-course with
              rapid childhood changes but a slow rate of decline in old age.
              Together, the time-courses of R1 and diffusion changes
              demonstrate that multiple biological processes drive changes in
              white-matter tissue properties over the lifespan.},

  abstract    = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an exciting new MRI modality
                 that can reveal detailed anatomy of the white matter. DTI also
                 allows us to approximate the 3D trajectories of major white
                 matter bundles. By combining the identified tract coordinates
                 with various types of MR parameter maps, such as T2 and
                 diffusion properties, we can perform tract-specific analysis
                 of these parameters. Unfortunately, 3D tract reconstruction is
                 marred by noise, partial volume effects, and complicated
                 axonal structures. Furthermore, changes in diffusion
                 anisotropy under pathological conditions could alter the
                 results of 3D tract reconstruction. In this study, we created
                 a white matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps
                 of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the DTI data from
                 28 normal subjects. Using these probabilistic maps, automated
                 tract-specific quantification of fractional anisotropy and
                 mean diffusivity were performed. Excellent correlation was
                 found between the automated and the individual
                 tractography-based results. This tool allows efficient initial
                 screening of the status of multiple white matter tracts.},

This poses a challenge for investigators to account for the variance due to scanner, as balanced sampling is often not an option. Similarly, longitudinal studies must deal with known and unknown changes to scanner hardware and software over time. In this manuscript, we have explored scanner-related differences in the dataset recently released by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) project, a multi-site, longitudinal study of children age 9-10. We demonstrate that scanner manufacturer, model, as well as the individual scanner itself, are detectable in the resting and task-based fMRI results of the ABCD dataset. We further demonstrate that these differences can be harmonized using an empirical Bayes approach known as ComBat. We argue that accounting for scanner variance, including even minor differences in scanner hardware or software, is crucial for any analysis.},

  abstract    = {Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
                 commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
                 experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
                 these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray
                 data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase
                 statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies
                 where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in
                 studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays.
                 In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without
                 adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to
                 filter batch effects from data, but these are often
                 complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to
                 implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are
                 conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods
                 are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric
                 empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch
                 effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and
                 performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
                 illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show
                 that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in
                 practice. Software for our method is freely available at:

  abstract = {Machine learning has enhanced the abilities of neuroscientists
              to interpret information collected through EEG, fMRI, and MEG
              data. With these powerful techniques comes the danger of
              overfitting of hyperparameters which can render results
              invalid. We refer to this problem as 'overhyping' and show
              that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions.
              Overhyping occurs when analysis decisions are made after
              observing analysis outcomes and can produce results that are
              partially or even completely spurious. It is commonly assumed
              that cross-validation is an effective protection against
              overfitting or overhyping, but this is not actually true. In
              this article, we show that spurious results can be obtained on
              random data by modifying hyperparameters in seemingly
              innocuous ways, despite the use of cross-validation. We
              recommend a number of techniques for limiting overhyping, such
              as lock boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested
              cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields
              that use machine learning, including computer science and
              physics. Adopting similar safeguards is critical for ensuring
              the robustness of machine-learning techniques in the
              neurosciences.},

                 has caused some to question whether AI must be explainable to
                 be used in high-stakes scenarios such as medicine. It has been
                 argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the
                 health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI

                 the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution

                 barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of
                 open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access
                 data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI
                 community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000
                 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the

                 many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent
                 global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the
                 original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high
                 magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors
                 in the US population, ii) highlight distinct population
                 sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify
                 non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic
                 kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model
                 deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are
                 degrading the model's performance over time. Given the
                 popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these
                 improvements to their interpretability have implications
                 across a broad set of domains.",
